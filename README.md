## About COVID-19 Product Hunt

During this unfortunate pandemic, United States stores have had an increasingly low supply of common household items such as paper towels, and toilet paper. These products are causing worry for millions, especially affected groups that are at risk to the disease as they can't as easily go out for extended periods of time to search from store to store for these products.

COVID-19 Product Hunt seeks to help those in search of these items by searching popular national chains for products in stock at the users specified location.
